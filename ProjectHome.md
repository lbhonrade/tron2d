Committing Revisions Using Subclipse:

1. Update for the latest revision first before committing to avoid overwriting the revisions of other developers.

2. If there's conflict, resolve first the conflict before committing.

3. Don't forget to place a log message indicating the changes.

4. Don't commit codes with error.
